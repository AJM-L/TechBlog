            </h3>
            <p class="article">
                As someone passionate about art and design, I have always been fascinated by the digital world and the creative possibilities it offers.

                The Basics of HTML
            </h3>
            <p class="article">
                HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of any web page. It provides the structure and content of a website. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage â€“ it defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Learning HTML has been an exciting journey, as it is the first step in creating a visually engaging website.
            <br>
                Some key elements I&#39;ve learned include:
                <br>
                Headings: &lth1> to &lth6> tags to define different levels of headings.  <br>
                Paragraphs: The  &ltp> tag for text content. <br>
                Images: The &ltimg> tag to embed images. <br>
                Links: The &lta> tag to create hyperlinks. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="article">
                Styling with CSS
            </h3>
            <p class="article">
                Once the structure is in place, style, position, and various other aspects can be manipulated with CSS. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows us to apply styles to HTML elements. With CSS, I can control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of a webpage.
                
                Some CSS concepts I&#39;ve been exploring include:
                
                Selectors: Targeting HTML elements to apply styles.
                Box Model: Understanding margins, borders, padding, and content.
                Flexbox and Grid: Creating responsive and flexible layouts.
                Animations: Adding dynamic effects to elements for a more engaging user experience.

                Bringing It All Together with JavaScript
            </h3>
            <p class="article">
                While HTML provides structure and CSS adds style, JavaScript brings interactivity to a website. It&#39;s a powerful programming language that allows us to create dynamic content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. JavaScript is like the brain of our webpage, making it smart and interactive.
                
                Some exciting JavaScript features I&#39;ve been working on include:
                
                DOM Manipulation: Interacting with HTML elements and changing their content or style. <br>
                Event Handling: Responding to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs. <br>
                APIs: Fetching data from external sources to display on the webpage. <br>
                Frameworks and Libraries: Exploring tools like React and jQuery to simplify development. <br>
