            <p class="article"> &emsp; Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs
                are a structure of neural networks used to create realistic
                synthetic data. They work by pitting two networks against
                eachother in a game where one network, the generator produces a
                fake image which is fed to the discriminator who returns the
                probability that the image is real. It is the goal of the
                generator to trick the discriminator by producing more and more
                realistic images, and it is the goal of the discriminator to
                accurately tell fake images from real ones. The competition
                between these two models allows the generator to produce
                realistic looking data from a provided dataset and some random
                noise. GANs are the models behind many contemporary generative
                tools, and are incredible complex and interesting generative systems.</p>
